# Fetch Timeout Retry

A lightweight implementation of timeouts and retries to the vanilla Fetch API.

Built with Typescript, types already included.

## Installation

`npm install fetch-timeout-retry`

## Usage

Just do a regular fetch request as you would normally do, but add a third argument with the timout and retry options.

Old-way:

```
fetch("https://myawesomeapi.xyz/path?params=123", {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: (...)
})
```

With `fetch-timeout-retry`

```
import { fetchTimeoutRetry } from 'fetch-timeout-retry'

fetchTimeoutRetry("https://myawesomeapi.xyz/path?params=123", {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: (...),
  {
    timeoutMs: 30000,
    maxRetries: 3
  }
})
```

If `timeoutMs < 1` it will be ignored and only retries will be considered.

The total quantity of retries will be of the original one plus the `maxRetries` value. So, if `maxRetries` is 4, the server will be called 5 times until erroring out (1 from the original call, and 4 from the retries).
